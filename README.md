## Why We Do This

We believe every African student should have the opportunity to pursue education in the U.S., but the road to getting there can be difficult and expensive. The cost of test prep, the complexity of the application process, and the lack of access to resources can all serve as barriers. **Africa Tumaini Academy** exists to break down those barriers, making the application process easier, more affordable, and accessible to all.

Our initiative is built on the idea that education should be accessible to everyone, regardless of background or financial resources. By offering free resources and mentorship, we hope to inspire a new generation of African students to reach for their dreams.
